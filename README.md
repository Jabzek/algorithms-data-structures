# Algorithms & Data Structures (University Projects)
This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in **Python**.
Projects were completed as part of the *A&DS* course at university during the second semester of study.

## Repository structure
- `sorting_algorithms_01` - Sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort)
- `bst_avl_algorithms_02` - BST and AVL trees (operations on the trees)
- `graph_algorithms_03` - Implementation of the graph and operations on it
- `backtracking_algorithms_04` - Backtracking algorithms on graphs (Hamiltonian cycle, Eulerian cycle)
- `knapsack_problem_05` - Dynamic programming and brute force solution for the Knapsack problem

## How to run
- Clone the repository:  
    git clone https://github.com/Jabzek/algorithms-data-structures.git  
    cd algorithms-data-structures
- To run specific project when you have already cloned the repository (for example first project):  
    cd sorting_algorithms_01  
    python3 main.py


  Attention - third and fourth project require to provide specific flag to run the code (check python3 main.py -h)
